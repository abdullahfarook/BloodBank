            <p>A blood Bank is a cache or bank of blood or blood components,gathered as a result of blood <br> donation or a collection stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. <br> The term"blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where storage of blood product occurs <br> and where proper testing is performed  (to reduce the risk of transfusion related adverse event).<br> However it sometimes refer to a collection center and indeed some hospitals also perform collection.<br>
                 <br>
                 While the first blood transfusions where made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation it<br> was discovered that by adding anticoagulant refrigerating the blood <br> it was possible to store it <br> for some days thus opening the way for the development of blood banks.<br>John Braxton hicks was the first to experiment with chemical method to prevent the coagulation of blood <br> at Marys Hospital London in the late 19 century. his attempt using phosphate soda however were unsuccessful.   </p>
